#  Power Grid Simulation

A beginner-level power systems engineering project built using Python.  
Simulates basic grid behavior and performs simple power flow calculations.

##  Features
- Node-based power flow setup
- Load and generation balancing
- Grid behavior modeling

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- Matplotlib

##  Files
- `grid_simulation.py`: main simulation script

##  Goals
This project was created as part of my electrical engineering learning journey.  
It demonstrates my interest in power systems and grid modeling.
